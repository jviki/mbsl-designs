The repository contains designs used to test MicroBlaze Simple Linux (MBSL).
It is separated to let the MBSL repository be as small as possible.

The designs are structured by the target FPGA type and the board they are intended
for. So the directory spartan6/ contains designs for this type of FPGA. Then files
for the Atlys board are named as atlys.bit (for the bitstream) etc. If a design has
a special purpose then it should be put in its name (eg atlys_video.{mhs,mss,...}).
